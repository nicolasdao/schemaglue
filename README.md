# What It Does
Make your code more readable and understandable by breaking down your monolithic GraphQL schema and resolver into smaller domain models. _**SchemaGlue.js**_ will help glueing them back together.

_**Without SchemaGlue - Stuck With a Monolithic Schema**_
```
- src/
   |__ schema.js

- index.js
- package.json
```
_**With SchemaGlue - Structure Your Schema At Will**_
```
- src/
   |__ graphql/
          |__ product/
          |       |__ schema.graphql
          |       |__ resolver.js
          |
          |__ variant/
                  |__ schema.graphql
                  |__ resolver.js

- index.js
- package.json
```

# Install
```
npm install schemaglue --save
```

# How To use It

>NOTICE: All the following examples use [__*webfunc*__](https://github.com/nicolasdao/webfunc) and [__*graphql-serverless*__](https://github.com/nicolasdao/graphql-serverless). _graphql-serverless_ makes developing GraphQl server locally dead easy while _webfunc_ is a serverless web framework that allows to write Express-like server to deploy them on any serverless solution.

## In Short
```js
const glue = require('schemaglue')

// This will look for any js files under the 'src/graphql' folder that 
// comply to a certain convention described below. Those files describe
// bits and pieces of the GraphQL schema and resolver that schemaglue will
// reassemble into a single 'schema' string and 'resolver' object.
const options = {
	js: '**/*.js', // default
	ignore: '**/somefileyoudonotwant.js',
	context: { dependencyA, dependencyB } // Passed into resolvers that are exported as functions
}
const { schema, resolver } = glue('src/graphql', options)
```

### Without SchemaGlue
>PREREQUISITE - Install the following dependencies before running the following code:
>
> `npm install webfunc graphql-serverless schemaglue lodash --save`
>

_Project Structure Example_
```
- src/
   |__ schema.js

- index.js
- package.json
```

Where the _schema.js_ file would contain the entire GraphQl schema and resolver definition:
```js
// src/schema.js

const { graphqlError } = require('graphql-serverless')
const { makeExecutableSchema } = require('graphql-tools') // this dependency is automatically included in 'graphql-serverless'
const _ = require('lodash')

const schema = `
type Product {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  shortDescription: String
}

type Variant {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  shortDescription: String
}

type Query {
  # ### GET products
  #
  # _Arguments_
  # - **id**: Product id (optional)
  products(id: Int): [Product]

  # ### GET variants
  #
  # _Arguments_
  # - **id**: Variant id (optional)
  variants(id: Int): [Variant]
}
`
const productMocks = [{ id: 1, name: 'Product A', shortDescription: 'First product.' }, { id: 2, name: 'Product B', shortDescription: 'Second product.' }]
const productResolver = {
  Query: {
    products(root, { id }, context) {
      const results = id ? productMocks.filter(p => p.id == id) : productMocks
      if (results.length > 0)
        return results
      else
        throw graphqlError(404, `Product with id ${id} does not exist.`)
    }
  }
}

const variantMocks = [{ id: 1, name: 'Variant A', shortDescription: 'First variant.' }, { id: 2, name: 'Variant B', shortDescription: 'Second variant.' }]
const variantResolver = {
  Query: {
    variants(root, { id }, context) {
      const results = id ? variantMocks.filter(p => p.id == id) : variantMocks
      if (results.length > 0)
        return results
      else
        throw graphqlError(404, `Variant with id ${id} does not exist.`)
    }
  }
}

const executableSchema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs: schema,
  resolvers: _.merge(productResolver, variantResolver) 
})

module.exports = {
  executableSchema
}
```

```js
// index.js

const { graphqlHandler } = require('graphql-serverless')
const { app } = require('webfunc')
const { executableSchema } = require('./src/schema')

const graphqlOptions = {
  schema: executableSchema,
  graphiql: { // If you do not want to host any GraphiQl web interface, leave this property undefined.
    endpoint: '/graphiql' 
  }
}

// Host a GraphQl API on 2 endpoints: '/' and '/graphiql'. '/graphiql' is used to host the GraphiQL web interface.
// If you're not interested in the GraphiQl web interface, leave the above 'graphqlOptions.graphiql' undefined and 
// replace the path following ['/', '/graphiql'] with '/'.
app.all(['/', '/graphiql'], graphqlHandler(graphqlOptions))

// Starting the server 
eval(app.listen('app', 4000))
```

Simply run `node index.js` and then browse to [http://localhost:4000/graphiql](http://localhost:4000/graphiql).

### With SchemaGlue
>PREREQUISITE - Install the following dependencies before running the following code:
>
> `npm install webfunc graphql-serverless schemaglue lodash --save`
>

_Project Structure Example_
```
- src/
   |__ graphql/
          |__ product/
          |       |__ schema.graphql
          |       |__ resolver.js
          |
          |__ variant/
                  |__ schema.graphql
                  |__ resolver.js

- index.js
- package.json
```

This is just one example of how to structure the schema and resolver. _**schemaglue**_ looks for all .js and .graphql files under a specific path.

```js
// src/graphql/product/schema.graphql

type Product {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  shortDescription: String
}

type Query {
  # ### GET products
  #
  # _Arguments_
  # - **id**: Product id (optional)
  products(id: Int): [Product]
}
```

```js
// src/graphql/product/resolver.js

const { graphqlError } = require('graphql-serverless')

const productMocks = [{ id: 1, name: 'Product A', shortDescription: 'First product.' }, { id: 2, name: 'Product B', shortDescription: 'Second product.' }]

exports.resolver = {
  Query: {
    products(root, { id }, context) {
      const results = id ? productMocks.filter(p => p.id == id) : productMocks
      if (results.length > 0)
        return results
      else
        throw graphqlError(404, `Product with id ${id} does not exist.`)
    }
  }
}
```

```js
// src/graphql/variant/schema.graphql

type Variant {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  shortDescription: String
}

type Query {
  # ### GET variants
  #
  # _Arguments_
  # - **id**: Variant id (optional)
  variants(id: Int): [Variant]
}
```

```js
// src/graphql/variant/resolver.js

const { graphqlError } = require('graphql-serverless')

const variantMocks = [{ id: 1, name: 'Variant A', shortDescription: 'First variant.' }, { id: 2, name: 'Variant B', shortDescription: 'Second variant.' }]

exports.resolver = {
  Query: {
    variants(root, { id }, context) {
      const results = id ? variantMocks.filter(p => p.id == id) : variantMocks
      if (results.length > 0)
        return results
      else
        throw graphqlError(404, `Variant with id ${id} does not exist.`)
    }
  }
}
```

```js
// index.js

const { graphqlHandler } = require('graphql-serverless')
const { app } = require('webfunc')
const { makeExecutableSchema } = require('graphql-tools') 
const glue = require('schemaglue')

const { schema, resolver } = glue('src/graphql')

const executableSchema = makeExecutableSchema({
    typeDefs: schema,
    resolvers: resolver
})

const graphqlOptions = {
  schema: executableSchema,
  graphiql: { 
    endpoint: '/graphiql' 
  }
}

app.all(['/', '/graphiql'], graphqlHandler(graphqlOptions))


eval(app.listen('app', 4000))
```

Simply run `node index.js` and then browse to [http://localhost:4000/graphiql](http://localhost:4000/graphiql).

## Typescript Support & Custom Globbing

By default, schemaglue uses .js files to define resolvers and .graphql files to define schemas. If your project uses Typescript, it is possible to change the default behavior to target resolvers that use .ts files:

```js
const { schema, resolver } = glue('src/graphql', { mode: 'ts' })
```

You can go even further by defining your own custom globbing rule if you want to only include certain resolver files:

```js
const { schema, resolver } = glue('src/graphql', { mode: 'product/*.js' })
```

The above will only get resolvers defined under the `src/graphql/product/` folder.


## Ignoring Certain Files
In some cases, you might want to ignore some specific files under the schema folder (by default, SchemaGlue will take into account all .js files). SchemaGlue adds support to ignore files or folders using [globbing](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob):
```js
const { schema, resolver } = glue('./src/graphql', { ignore: '**/somefile.js' })
```
This will take into account all .js files under the folder _./src/graphql_, excluding all _somefile.js_ files. The _**ignore**_ property supports both a single string or an array of strings. 
```js
// Ignore more than 1 specific .js file
const { schema:schema1 } = glue('./src/graphql', { ignore: ['**/somefile.js', '**/someotherfile.js'] })
// Ignore all files under the ./src/graphql/variant folder
const { schema:schema1 } = glue('./src/graphql', { ignore: 'variant/**' })
```

## Custom Extensions
You can specify a custom glob to select your resolver files with different extensions.
```js
const { schema, resolver } = glue('./src/graphql', { js: '**/*.ts' })
```

## Using Functional Dependency Injection Inside Resolvers

To facilitate functional dependency injection, resolvers can be exported as functions with a single `context` argument. When glueing everything together using `glue('src/graphql', options)`, `options.context` gets passed into each resolver's `context` argument. `context` is best used as a hash of dependencies. This pattern facilitates the unit testing of resolvers by allowing dependencies to be easily mocked.

Basic example passing in raw data:

```js
// app.js
const productMocks = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Product 1', shortDescription: 'Product #1.' }, 
  { id: 2, name: 'Product 2', shortDescription: 'Product #2.' }
]
const { schema, resolver } = glue('src/graphql', { context: { productMocks } })
    
// src/graphql/product/resolver.js
exports.resolver = context => {
  return {
    Query: {
      products(root, { id }) {
        const { productMocks } = context
        const results = id ? productMocks.filter(p => p.id == id) : productMocks
        return results ||  null
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Advanced example passing in a curried function that encapsulates the shared database connection. This makes testing resolvers incredibly easy:

```js
// app.js
const sharedDatabaseConnection = ...
const GetProducts = ProductsService.GetProducts({ db: sharedDatabaseConnection }) // curried function so we don't have to pass the shared database connection around
const { schema, resolver } = glue('src/graphql', { context: { GetProducts } })

// src/graphql/product/resolver.js
exports.resolver = context => {
  return {
    Query: {
      products(root, { id }) {
        const { GetProducts } = context
        return GetProducts(id) // resolver has no direct reference to the shared database connection
      }
    }
  }
}

// test/graphql/product/resolver-test.js
it('returns the correct products for a given id', () => {
  const GetProducts = id => ([{ id: id, name: 'Special product', shortDescription: 'My special product mock.' }])
  const { resolver } = glue('src/graphql', { context: { GetProducts } })
  assert.deepEqual(resolver.Query.products(null, { id: 1 }), [{ id: 1, name: 'Special product', shortDescription: 'My special product mock.' }])
})
```

## Interesting Examples
_**Unions & Interfaces**_

If you're not familiar with this concept, check out this great article [GraphQL Tour: Interfaces and Unions](https://medium.com/the-graphqlhub/graphql-tour-interfaces-and-unions-7dd5be35de0d). 

In our case, we're interested is knowing how to structure our code with unions or interfaces. If your schema is small, I would recommend to manage your unions and intefaces definitions inside a single schema.js file per model:
```
- src/
   |__ graphql/
          |__ product/
          |       |__ schema.graphql
          |       |__ resolver.js
          |
          |__ variant/
                  |__ schema.graphql
                  |__ resolver.js

- index.js
- package.json
```
Let's take the _schema.graphql_ and _resolver.js_ under _src/graphql/product/_ as an example:

_schema.graphql_
```js
union Product = Bicycle | Racket

type Bicycle {
	id: ID!
	brand: String!
	wheels: Int!
}

type Racket {
	id: ID!
	brand: String!
	sportType: SportType!
}

enum SportType {
	TENNIS
	SQUASH
}

type Query {
  # ### GET products
  #
  # _Arguments_
  # - **id**: Product id (optional)
  products(id: Int): [Product]
}
```

_resolver.js_
```js
const { graphqlError } = require('graphql-serverless')

const productMocks = [{ 
  id: 1,
  brand: 'Giant',
  wheels: 2 
},{ 
  id: 2,
  brand: 'Prince',
  sportType: 'TENNIS' 
}]

exports.resolver = {
  Query: {
    products(root, { id }, context) {
      const results = id ? productMocks.filter(p => p.id == id) : productMocks
      if (results.length > 0)
        return results
      else
        throw graphqlError(404, `Product with id ${id} does not exist.`)
    }
  },

  Product: {
    __resolveType(obj, context, info) {
      return  obj.wheels ? 'Bicycle' :
          obj.sportType ? 'Racket' : null
    }
  }
}
```
> Notice you need to define a _resolveType_ method for the _Product_ type under the _exports.resolver_

# Contribute
## General Guidance
We're always super excited to accept pull-requests. We're not too nazi on how you implement your fixes or desired features, but we would still highly appreciate if you could:

1. Lint your code using the command `npm run eslint` before pushing your pull-request.
2. Make sure you've added a unit test under the `test` folder (more about that in the following section).
3. Make sure all the unit tests pass by running `npm test`

### THANKS A LOT YOU AWESOME GOD COMMITTER!

## Unit Testing
All unit tests are located under the `test` folder. There, you will notice 3 main components:

1. `graphql` folder: This folder contains a series of mock files that you should use to test schemaglue. Feel free to add your own, but please, stick to the already defined naming convention.
2. `index.js`: This file is the main unit test file. You will most probably add your unit test there. Please, stick with the naming convention in that file.
3. `utils.js`: This file contains the unit tests for the src/utils.js code. Please, stick with the naming convention in that file.

To run the test, simply execute this command: `npm test`.
